**StudyNotion: Online Education Platform (MERN Stack)**

---

## **Project Overview**
StudyNotion is a fully functional ed-tech platform designed to enable users to create, consume, and rate educational content. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), StudyNotion aims to:

- Provide an interactive and seamless learning experience for students.
- Offer a platform for instructors to share knowledge and engage with learners worldwide.

The following sections provide a technical breakdown of the platform, covering architecture, front-end and back-end functionalities, API design, deployment, and future enhancements.

## **System Architecture**
StudyNotion follows a client-server architecture, where the front end serves as the client and the back end (server) interacts with the database. The system comprises three main components:

### **1. Front End**
- Built with React.js to ensure a dynamic and responsive UI.
- Communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
- State management using Redux.
- Styling with CSS and Tailwind.

### **2. Back End**
- Built using Node.js and Express.js.
- Handles API requests, user authentication, course management, and media handling.
- Implements JWT-based authentication and security features.

### **3. Database**
- Utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store user and course data.
- Implements flexible data storage to manage structured and semi-structured data.

## **Back End Features**
The back-end architecture follows a monolithic approach with robust security and scalable data handling.

### **Core Functionalities:**
- **User Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based authentication with OTP verification and password reset.
- **Course Management:** Instructors can create, edit, and delete courses.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure transactions via Razorpay.
- **Media Handling:** Cloudinary is used for storing and managing course content.
- **Data Security:** Bcrypt for password hashing.

### **Key Technologies Used:**
- **Node.js** for the backend server.
- **MongoDB** as the primary database.
- **Express.js** for handling API routes.
- **JWT** for authentication.
- **Mongoose** for database interaction.

## **API Design**
The StudyNotion API follows the REST architectural style with standard HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). JSON is used for data exchange.

### **Key API Endpoints:**

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login and JWT generation.
- `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - OTP verification.
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset process.

**Course Management:**
- `GET /api/courses` - Retrieve all courses.
- `GET /api/courses/:id` - Fetch details of a specific course.
- `POST /api/courses` - Create a new course.
- `PUT /api/courses/:id` - Update an existing course.
- `DELETE /api/courses/:id` - Remove a course.
- `POST /api/courses/:id/rate` - Add course ratings.

**Sample API Request & Response:**
```json
GET /api/courses
Response:
{
  "courses": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "React for Beginners",
      "description": "Learn React from scratch",
      "rating": 4.8
    }
  ]
}
```
